where id equals (lamdbda x x). id is self applied
twice. the result is applied to a string.)

) (lambda x x) 

(text this is a string. hello!)

(comment the behavior of \, ), and ( in text are 
undefined. text can be sugar for pairs of booleans
in the lambda calculus. if fastlisp halts it returns
a lambda that can guide macro expansion in the outer
system extending the syntax. a fastlisp compiler
compiles a fastlisp lambda to blc2.)
